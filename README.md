**MALgraph is an extension of your MyAnimeList profile**, showing you lots of stats, lists, anime/manga recommendations, and even allowing you to compare your stats with other users. It works for anime and manga lists, and the more titles you have listed, the more accurate results you can expect.

## Other things worth mentioning
This is the third version of Mg. The first one only showed the rating distribution, while its successor was a lot richer in content, but everything was presented in one overwhelming cluster of data. Mg3 has everything split into tabs, with more features and less distracting things, like humongous formulas shown in tooltips.

All user's data is downloaded once a day. After a successful download, the HTML version of all pages is cached. This ensures that MALgraph won't be a huge threat to MAL's servers - we only download the data once per 24 hours, which is a tiny fraction of an average user's browsing activity. Anime and manga data is cached too, with its lifespan depending on airing state - whether it's airing, finished airing or isn't out yet. [More info can be found here](https://github.com/rr-/malgraph/wiki/Optimization-details).

We have a club on MAL, where feature requests and bug reports are most welcome. We prefer to maintain the issues tab on GitHub ourselves. [Click here to visit the club](http://myanimelist.net/clubs.php?cid=30017).
